## Project Overview
The project is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree and [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) is the starter code. The canvas and the sprites are provided by Udacity. I have implemented the Player and the Enemy classes with their methods, using Object-Oriented JavaScript. 


## How to play
Reach the water without colliding into any one of the enemies (Bugs).

You can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. You have three opportunities, once the player collides with an enemy, you lose a life and the game is reset. Once you reach the water the game is won.
